Hi! Thanks for stopping by. I am a research scientist at [Shannon.AI](http://www.shannonai.com/). I
obtained my B.S. from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University.
My work at ShannonAI deals with Natural Lanuguage Processing. Here, I build deep learning systems for real-world
NLP applications. Back in college, I did research in computer vision, including object decection, scene text
detection, recognition, etc.

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page]&#40;/al-folio/publications/&#41; automatically.)

Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.)
